# gamesneeze-linux
Made by [sekcea](https://github.com/seksea/gamesneeze). My rating: 8.5/10, best linux cheat performance-wise, feature-wise a bit behind Fuzion.

lukizel is my default config (esp+backtrack and some other shit), dz_lukizel is the same but including teammates in ESP so that you can see enemies.
